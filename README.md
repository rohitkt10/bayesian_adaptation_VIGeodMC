# bayesian_adaptation_VIGeodMC
Contains the tool functions to implement the Bayesian methodology presented in the paper:

P. Tsilifis and R. Ghanem, **Bayesian adaptation of chaos representations using variational inference and sampling on geodesics**. *Submitted to Proceedings of the Royal Society A* (2018).


### Requirements:
The Polynomial Chaos library chaos_basispy (https://pypi.org/project/chaos-basispy/) that is available in my GitHub profile is necessary for utilizing both the Variational Inference (VI) and Geodesic Monte Carlo algorithms.
